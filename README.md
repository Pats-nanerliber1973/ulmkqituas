Oh my God, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Jumbo and I am in a whirlwind of emotions 🤯... seriously, what even was that??? LOL. Like, you start off thinking you’re in for a chill, artsy kinda 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮, but then BAM! Here’s a gal getting all emotional over a freakin' amusement park ride. 😆 I mean, I’m all for “love is love,” but girl, really?? 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 out — next time I’ll end up falling for my highlighter palette or something. 😂

So, like, totally didn’t expect to get all wrapped up in it, but there I was, rooting for this chic and her giant metal boyfriend. And the mom, OMG, she’s just like every overbearing mom out there: “Why can’t you be normal?” Meanwhile, her daughter's in love with a robot. Honestly, I bet half of them don’t even last as long as a good foundation. 😏 Anyway, kinda wish I’d just decided to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   sooner, would have saved an existential crisis or two during those long makeup gigs. 💄

> Legit got me thinking though, humans dating anything nowadays... next thing you know, we’re gonna have scandals between people and their vacuum cleaners. Can you imagine the tabloids? “MAN LEAVES WIFE FOR DYSON!” 🤣 Anyway, if you haven’t 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 the   yet, do it — and then get back to me. I need someone to laugh/cry about this with.

Oh, and the visuals!! Like, I’m low-key obsessed with that neon glow. It’s like eye shadow on steroids. Just waiting for the day I rock up to a gig and someone’s like, “make me look like a carnival ride in love.” 😂 Bold look of the 𝘴𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘰𝘯, calling it now. But seriously, between you and me, we’d kill a look like that. ✨

int main() { return 0; } // why did I put this here? 😂

Anyway, enough of my rambling, back to reality and the endless pursuit of perfect cat eyes... or maybe I’ll go find a bumper car to fall in love with. 😜 Let’s chat soon, lemme know if you catch the flick!
